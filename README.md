# Memory Game created with HTML, CSS3, and jQuery
#### An interactive "memory game." Created individual tiles, with multiple layers, and used absolute positioning to rest layers on top of one another. Each tile has a universal image on the "back," and a unqiue monster image on the "front." On document load, the tiles are facing with their "back" up.
####  Added click listener with jQuery to inititate CSS3 transform and transition properties to rotate tile 180 degrees and reveal the "front." If click on two tiles with matching fronts, the tiles front will remain visible. If click two tiles without matching fronts, tiles will rotate to reaveal their "back."
#### Added Easy, Medium, and Expert diffictuly buttons. Each button creates unique HTML grid with different number of tiles.
